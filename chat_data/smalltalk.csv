generally good but few issues re hurricane
"Interims looked ok to me above expectations. What you guys thinking? The bussness looking safe and dividend keeps rolling in, some of the figures look nice."
Nice spike upwards - 60k purchase -wouldn't have thought that on its own would have caused the rise but I could be wrong.
Third Avenue Management increased its stake twice in as many months - bid in the offing from over the pond perhaps? This could explain the steady rise although I personally think the rise is justified on fundamentals alone.
waiting for 280p
It is rare for insurance underwriters to be taken over. It is more likely that staff who perform underwriting get poached by a rival.

"I was wondering if forced insurer selling might hit the stockmarkets but Harvey damage was estimated at only $2bn to $4bn, compared to Katrina's $50bn. (Note - most insurers exclude flood damage so Texas will take a big hit through uninsured losses.)"
" Souns like a plan. Hurricane insurance is expensive for everyone in the state, but each hurricane destroys relatively few properties. Outwith a long series of hurricanes spread over the whole state, they are probably on a winner as long as the premiums are suitably high. "
