,poseidon adventure,No?,,,,,
,temmujin,Feels I‚Äôve been here watching this thing crawl for long enough ,,,,,
,poseidon adventure,When it turns it‚Äôll turn from subtrop to megacat levels in a few hours,,,,,
,temmujin,You ever seen one of those?,,,,,
,poseidon adventure,"Yeah, the last time Miami went down. lost most of my portfolio that day. Felt pretty rough. Amazing though.",,,,,
,temmujin,"Damn, sorry to hear it.",,,,,
,poseidon adventure,"It‚Äôs fine, I learned a lot and made it back. The energy in the room back then was intense, though, I miss it. Some of the older folks here straight up retired that day, I haven‚Äôt seen them since.",,,,,
,temmujin,It‚Äôll be years before another hit on Miami now,,,,,
,poseidon adventure,"Probably, you never know, the market gets antsy whenever we bring the eye within 200 miles of south beach",,,,,
,temmujin,"Yeah, but it‚Äôs been so calm lately",,,,,
,poseidon adventure,"Touch wood! :) I know what you mean, it‚Äôs been hard to make much progress on these last few cycles. A lot of folks have gone back to regular stocks.",,,,,
,temmujin,"You‚Äôre still here though, you never get the feeling you‚Äôre just waiting for nothing to happen?",,,,,

,JasperTheMonkeyGod,How‚Äôs everyone feeling today?!,Start,,,,
,Henchard,Chem trails are real and are effecting the climate. Jet contrails dropped globally which saw a spike in UV rays. The fuel contains higher levels of Sulphur compared to commercial fuel which is refined with Cobalt to remove the impurities.,,,,,
,Cyan,OK! ,,,,,
,aceta,Why should I care about sea raising and global warming if I'll be dead in around 55 years??,,,,,

,Cyan,‚Ä¶,,,,,
,temmujin,Have you noticed the trees started growing at different rates later into the year and it's October but they're still green?,,,,,
,temmujin,"The tree at the bottom of my yard is still in full bloom. It's barely yellowed, it's barely shed any leaves. Trees in the neighborhood are all in the same state. They're always half bare by the middle of September. Always.",,,,,
,temmujin,"They bloomed a lot later this year too, way into middle and late April.",,,,,
,temmujin,Why is this happening? This year of all years. What the fuck is happening to the world? I'm fucking scared.,,,,,
,Blueish,"i think we're definitely in for an ice age, just not before climate change gives the planet a nice toasting.",,,,,
,temmujin,"We're IN the Ice Age! The current plateau of the past 10,000-12,000 years (Holocene era) is ending and we're leveling off into cooler ages.",,,,,
,Blueish,"Climate change in action. We did this to ourselves. Want something scarier? The ice caps are on fire. Look up ""zombie fires"".",,,,,

,Boxerdogz,why the fuck is Europe so geographically boring?,,,,,
,Boxerdogz,"Meteorologically yes, they actually have a lot of rocks though",,,,,
,Boxerdogz,That‚Äôs why I stay on the north atlantic cat servers,,,,,
,Boxerdogz,How the fuck does anyone make insurance money there?,,,,,
,Boxerdogz,"Fires and floods, mostly. Fire insurance started with the Hamburg guilds: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_Feuerkasse",,,,,
,Boxerdogz,"Lol that‚Äôs why all the reinsurers are in Europe, no danger of getting wiped out",,,,,

,temmujin,DO NOT TRUST THIS TRADER,Start,,,,
,temmujin,david is well known as a compulsive liar making all sorts of ridiculous claims.,,,,,
,temmujin,"he tries to get others to follow him, in theory supporting a note's price, by claiming to hold vast amounts of notes (well, it must be good then), and claiming to have worked as a senior broker for one of the big insurance houses.",,,,,
,temmujin,Nothing but a fraud and a liar...and a serial loser.,,,,,
,Blueish,"Dont just take my word for it, plenty on here will back me up, on this",,,,,

,Cyanise,All the buys are sells‚Ä¶,,,,,
,JasperTheMonkeyGod,Boys I think we‚Äôve got a shorter in our midst,,,,,
,Cyan,How do you short a hurricane???,,,,,
,temmujin,"No idea, but these prices are way off",,,,,
,temmujin,"Same way you short any other bond, you just take a sell position and scrape it all up from the bottom",,,,,
,temmujin,"But the weather doesn‚Äôt care about your position, if you end up with a megacat you‚Äôre screwed",,,,,

,Cyan,"Quite pleasant in Surrey. Now that the new contract has turned out to be a misunderstanding , I trust that the prof will be doing the decent thing and walking away as promised. Otherwise he might lead others to label him lying filth or lying scum.",,,,,
,temmujin,Oof.,,,,,
,temmujin,Let‚Äôs all just make a little money between friends and keep it civil.,End,,,,
,temmujin,any weather today ?,Start,,,,

,Cyan,Feels like deja vu‚Ä¶,Start,,,,
,temmujin,Maybe we‚Äôve literally been watching the same storm play out for a thousand years,,,,,
,temmujin,We kind of *literally* have??,,,,,
,temmujin,In that case shouldn‚Äôt all future storms be priced in?,,,,,
,temmujin,"That‚Äôd be nice, we wouldn‚Äôt have to watch this crap unfold live",,,,,
,Blueish,And you‚Äôd all have to move back into your mom‚Äôs basement,,,,,
,temmujin,Lmao,,,,,
,Blueish,Speak for yourself [uuid.previous.agentName],,,,,
,aceta,If all the storms were priced in there‚Äôd be no market‚Ä¶,,,,,
,Cyanise,"You‚Äôre looking at one version of the future here, the price tells you if there are other uncertainty in the works",,,,,
,JasperTheMonkeyGod,Or at least the ones that we know about,,,,,
,Cyan,So what happens to the insurance if the market doesn‚Äôt buy in?,,,,,
,temmujin,"If there‚Äôs no-one here to take on the risk, they‚Äôll have to go somewhere else",,,,,
,temmujin,Or they just pay up more until someone buys in,,,,,

,JasperTheMonkeyGod,Every time there‚Äôs a near miss you guys are so silent,Start,,,,
,Cyan,it‚Äôs like watching a bunch of slack-jawed millenarians on the day after the meteor was supposed to hit earth,,,,,
,temmujin,It was so close to making a megacat!,,,,,
,temmujin,No company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion megacat.,,,,,
,temmujin,Surely the downsides are priced in,,,,,
,temmujin,"I think the downside isn't built in just yet; plenty of businesses have gone down 95% after a catastrophe. I'm sure the people here are well aware of the risks and have taken steps, but it might be wise for shareholders to hedge some/most/all of their holding, but that's just a passing thought, not advice, 'cause I'm not an advisor and my guesses are often plain wrong.",,,,,
,Blueish,So in other words the losses are limitless,,,,,
,temmujin,Yes.,,,,,
,Blueish,Good luck everyone :)),End,,,,
,aceta,Do they have models for this or is it just crude guessing?,Start,,,,
,Cyanise,"A bit of both, I think",,,,,
,JasperTheMonkeyGod,"Well, these movement are based on insurance models, not climate models",,,,,
,Cyan,Don‚Äôt they use the same meteorology simulations?,,,,,
,temmujin,"Sort of, but the insurance models are only built to predict the next year‚Äôs season. It‚Äôs just historic weather ‚Äì they don‚Äôt care about emissions, and they don‚Äôt have a measure of the climate itself changing.",,,,,
,temmujin,And the price is built off of that,,,,,
,temmujin,"Yeah, the price represents the collateralised value at risk for a major cat event, or the expected losses across the industry that season.",,,,,
,temmujin,And if the climate changes?,,,,,
,Blueish,"The contracts are only per season, so‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt make much difference for now",,,,,
,temmujin,Cats are getting more frequent it feels like,,,,,
,Blueish,But there‚Äôs too much pressure from the state to keep premiums low,,,,,
,aceta,"Surely, the cost of hurricane insurance must make it worthwhile to consider a re-location.",,,,,
,Cyanise,"Well I‚Äôm an underwriter on the reinsurance side and increases of 25-40% were not unusual - my buildings insurance has just been quoted with a 25 % increase no losses, !",,,,,
,JasperTheMonkeyGod,"Probably, but the market keeps growing every year so it seems like the homeowners are staying put",End,,,,
,Cyan,I‚Äôve got this thing in my finger,Start,,,,
,temmujin,"My hand looks fine otherwise, but one finger is completely white",,,,,
,temmujin,"And then, after a while, it goes into the next finger",,,,,
,temmujin,You wanna get that checked out,,,,,
,temmujin,Yeah‚Ä¶,End,,,,
