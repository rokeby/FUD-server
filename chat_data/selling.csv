MANY PEOPLE I USED TO HOLD IN HIGHEST ESTEEM ARE BEWRISH
Feels like despair is pretty close
"In the midst of market uncertainty, I have 0 worries about holding long term A notes."
Whoâ€™s buying the dips?
HODLing onâ€¦
"Whatever happens now, if you hold fast, will succeed."
Liquidity added
Waiting for the bottom to hit
Ominous..
"Strange fall at the end today, no sell off to speak of. And buys outweighing sells."
Tree shaking?
Price ticking up wards last week or so. Lack of hurracanes? (however you spell it)
Why the large drop today? Any ideas? fh
chart not looking too happy
It's got nothing to do with the Hathaway-owned reinsurer General Reisurance UK being fined Â£1.2m by the FSA has it?
Is it the falling dollar then?
will stand back for now
She taking a kicking last few days- hope they still buying back the notes!
"Yes, suppose we will now see how much that has helped to under pin the price."
Someone knows something we don't. I don't like the look of this.
"good luck! This is one sick puppy, but why?"
Continued fall in the price in the post dealing session. A reassuring statement from the board would not come amiss. I see Goldman Sachs have got rid of an undisclosed no. of shares. Are institutions trying to improve their liquidity by having fire sales?
annoying
how do you call bottoms in this market?
Apparently recent drop is due to exposure to the $ and sub-prime fears
"Taken a big hit today, hope nothing too serious, think they all took pasting, but we fell the most."
still descending...
driven by Deusche bank selling some ?
Will these ever stop going down?
"which broker? I needed the money today for bargains elsewhere, arrgh!"
Computer says should have held more Novactye you numbnut.
Stifel is an irrelevance - seen them do their stuff before - Hurricane being one.
Collapsing. Approaching 2p
JT & hurricanes are bedfellows.. I do not suppose the dozy bunch at PRE have ANY hurricane insurance.!!
"Dark again , possibly the darkest of the year."
Weather news is out and the outlook is still gloomy.
It's grim oop north.
It's the end of the world..
"Buying kicking in now,could see a blue finish :)"
"Now is the winter of our discontent, time to play â€˜pin the tail on the donkeyâ€™ with a wildcat expo well? They still need more cash imo to safely conduct ops in demobilisation though..."
"Why would a major spaff cash over a wildcat? What they will do is watch, wait, verify commercial after a well test and then decide?"
Not a lot of joy for any of us today it seems.
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! (screaming)
:lol: 
Hahahahaha hahahahaha IDIOTS IN THE DARK ðŸ˜€
perhaps itâ€™s our â€˜friendâ€™ selling the last of his holding!! Pmsl
collapsing- dilution imminent.
Certainly worth a punt now
And this will not be enough. Good luck MUGS and idiots in the dark. Enjoy tomorrow. Hahahahaha
That was a brilliant pump before dump hahhahahha
Maybe Swiss Re and MS&AD have been lightening their holdin

Oil is up due to a non-war and the North Sea producing a bit less than the tiny amount it normally does ? Who needs fundamentals when you can ramp on the back of that hot air?!?!
