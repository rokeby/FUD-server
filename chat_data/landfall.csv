sheâ€™s landed
Landfall!!
â€¦and now it gets interesting
thatâ€™s a lot of farm damage right off the bat
is she gonna beach??
wake me up when weâ€™re in miami
she's made it!!
tjis is where it gets spicy
Not looking good on the coast
landfall imminent
"I reckon its gonna beach in the next 20min, hold tight till then"
buying big before she lands
"itâ€™s gonna back down before, has to"
landfall is gonna break this one right down
this speedâ€™s never gonna sustain once sheâ€™s over the coast
aaaaanf thatâ€™s why you have flood defences ðŸ™ƒ
"This oneâ€™s going to do a lot of damage, mark my words."
landfall in 10â€¦.. 9â€¦.. 8â€¦.
