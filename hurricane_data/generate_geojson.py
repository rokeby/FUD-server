# read in the csv

# use map libs to calculate risk at each step

# generate a 'value' for the storm based on hi risk areas in a 100k radius

# set risk levels at which bond tranches are sold, and the associated rates

# for each point on the hurricane, interpolate 10 points

# generate a cone of uncertainty for each point

# if the cone of uncertainty intersects a major urban area, get the radius
# and update the risk value accordingly

# tag with new tranches etc

# generate 'report' paragraph about each storm
